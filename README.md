This project implements a shell based Calculator Application. This Calculator can handle the basic 4 arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/).
This is implemented by using a modified Binary Tree and inserting a postfix notation of the expression into the tree and running a modified postorder search on the tree.
To compile, run
g++ main.cpp ExpressionParser.cpp BinaryTree.cpp Calculator.cpp BTNode.cpp
Then run the executable file to run the application.
